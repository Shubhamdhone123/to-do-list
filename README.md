# to-do-list

Each task item displays its name, due date, priority, and completion status.
Tasks can be marked as complete or deleted.
Implement filters for sorting tasks by date, priority, or completion status.

Task Details:
Users can click on a task to view more details.
Show full task description, due date, priority, and any tags/categories.
